**Grammatical Forms**

- "including", "includes" or any derivation of those words does not limit the matter in question to the things specifically mentioned in the applicable context;

- when any kind of legislative instrument is referenced, the reference will be take to be that instrument as updated or substituted for by the legislative body in any way;
- where a “URL” is mentioned, the non-operation of the “URL” will not render the rights and obligations associated with it invalid;
