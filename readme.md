# Sensible Interpretation (Australia) 

### Purpose

Sensible Interpretation is a language module for **Australian** legal agreements.  It sets out the rules for interpreting documents that make up a legal agreement.  It's particularly useful for agreements that deal with technical matters.  

Rather than explaining industry terms in the document, you can just put them in inverted commas, and they are interpreted according to what an expert in the relevant field would think.

### Use cases

Sensible Interpretation can be used in any agreement, but is particularly useful for agreements that have technical subject matter.

### Not Legal Advice

This is not legal advice.  Lawyers are involved in producing these terms, but they obviously aren't familiar with your circumstances.  Speak to your lawyer to make sure that Sensible Boilerplate is well aligned with your circumstances.

### Licence

Sensible Interpretation is released under the license in license.md.
